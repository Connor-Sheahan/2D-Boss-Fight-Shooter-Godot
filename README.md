# 2D-Boss-Fight-Shooter-Godot

A small and completely original game that I coded in Godot, using GDScript, for a grade 12 computer science project. 

The game is a 2D single room boss fight. You use WASD to move and spacebar to jump. You hold down left click to shoot, and the bullets are shot in the direction of your cursor (full 360 degree aim).

The game is included as an executable, and the scripts are included as .txt files in the "Scripts" folder. Note: The .exe must be in the same folder as the .pck to run!

This is one of the games that I am most proud of, especially due to the fact that I also made all the art for this project.
